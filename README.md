# NeedleExtraction

The "main.py" program is used to find the curvature of a needle based on the markers.<br />

Usage:<br />
The main program taks two required image paths.<br /><br />
--calibration_dir takes a string that points to a checkerboard ***image*** for camera calibration. The checkerboard must have a pattern 8x4. The the checkerboard should also occupy 
as much area as possible to ensure a good calculation for camera calibration calculation.<br />
--image_dir takes a string that points to a ***folder*** that contains all the needle images. <br />
